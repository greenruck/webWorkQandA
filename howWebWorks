HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a set of rules to communicate between browser and webserver

URL is Uniform Resource Locator, it is the address of a webpage on the internet

Domain Name System translates human readable domain names to machine readable IP addresses

Query Strings are extra information such as searches and arguments that can be found at the end of a URL. Often shown as ?()=(some value)

GET and POST; Get is used when the request without side effects, POST has side effects such as saving information that are sent as body of the request 

Method is sent and the HTTP ProtocolVersion is received, get the URL we want, headers are included

HTTP Requests are sent by the user to start an event on the server i.e. get and post

HTTP response is sent from the server to a user. It gives the user the resource they requested

Headers let the user and server pass additional information in the request or response. Include hostname, date, language you want, cookies, content type, caching.

When I type http://site.com/some/page.html the host name translates to an IP address then connects to that address. Using HTTP protocol a request is made for the resource desired and is passed as query string
